abstract: Network traffic classification has been widely studied to fundamentally advance network measurement and management. Machine Learning is one of the effective approaches for network traffic classification. Specifically, Deep Learning (DL) has attracted much attention from the researchers due to its effectiveness even in encrypted network traffic without compromising neither user privacy nor network security. However, most of the existing models are created from closed-world datasets, thus they can only classify those existing classes previously sampled and labeled. In this case, unknown classes cannot be correctly classified. To tackle this issue, an autonomous learning framework is proposed to effectively update DL-based traffic classification models during active operations. The core of the proposed framework consists of a DL-based classifier, a self-learned discriminator, and an autonomous self-labeling model. The discriminator and self-labeling process can generate new dataset during active operations to support classifier update. Evaluation of the proposed framework is performed on an open dataset, i.e., ISCX VPN-nonVPN, and independently collected data packets. The results demonstrate that the proposed autonomous learning framework can filter packets from unknown classes and provide accurate labels. Thus, corresponding DL-based classification models can be updated successfully with the autonomously generated dataset.
