abstract: Network intrusion detection is the fundamental of the Cybersecurity
  which plays an important role in preventing the systems away from malicious
  network traffic. Recent Artificial Intelligence (AI) based intrusion detection
  systems provide simple and accurate intrusion detection compared with the
  conventional intrusion detection schemes, however, the detection performance
  may not be reliable because the models in the AI algorithms must output a
  prediction result for each incoming instance even when the models are not
  confident. To tackle the issue, we propose to adopt Bayesian Deep Learning,
  specifically, Bayesian Convolutional Neural Network, to build intrusion
  detection models. Moreover, an ensemble-based detection scheme is further
  proposed to enhance the detection performance. Two open datasets (i.e.,
  NSL-KDD and UNSW-NB15) are used to evaluate the proposed schemes. In
  comparison, Convolutional Neural Network and Support Vector Machine are
  implemented as baseline IDS (i.e., CNN-IDS and SVM-IDS). The evaluation
  results demonstrate that the proposed BCNN-IDS can significantly boost the
  detection accuracy and reduce the false alarm rate by adopting the proposed
  T-ensemble detection scheme.
